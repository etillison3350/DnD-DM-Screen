Until then, a severed part acts on the troll\u0027s initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has AC 13, 10 hit points, and the troll\u0027s Regeneration trait.\n    A severed leg is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet.\n    A severed arm has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless the troll can see the arm and its target. Each time the troll loses an arm, it loses a claw attack.\n\nIf its head is severed, the troll loses its bite attack and its body is blinded unless the head can see it. The severed head has a speed of 0 feet and the troll\u0027s Keen Smell trait. It can make a bite attack, but only against a creature in its space.\nThe troll\u0027s speed is halved if it is mmissing a leg. If it loses both legs, it falls prone. If it still has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can\u0027t benefit from bonuses to its speed."}],"actions":[{"class":"Action","name":"Multiattack","note":"","description":"The troll makes three attacks: one with its bite, and two with its claws.

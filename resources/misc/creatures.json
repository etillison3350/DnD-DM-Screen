On a failed save, a target is treated as though it were wearing metal armor for the purpose of the golem\u0027s Magnetic feature. In addition, the target\u0027s attacks ignore the golem\u0027s Magnetic feature, and the target\u0027s melee attacks or ranged attacks that would deal lightning damage are made with a -5 penalty to the attack roll, as they are repelled from the golem. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."}],"reactions":[],"legendaryActions":[]}]
